Contacts
===========

This project will display a users contacts in a searchable list.

##Searching

Note that there is an extra search feature. Searches done on the friend 
list have been designed to return results with the best user experience 
in mind, which in this case means making some assumptions.

Here we assume that when searching for a friend, a user will do so by 
first name. We therefore return results that begin with the search text
first. This means that Garrett Burnett will appear before Brandon
Garrett when searching for 'Garrett'.
